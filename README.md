# ðŸ“š Trash Treasure

Traveling in Japan is fun. You are visiting all the famous spots in Tokyo and you get hungry. You buy snacks and drinks at the convenience store. You're happy and full, but now you have empty wrappers and PET bottles. There isn't a trash bin nearby and you don't want to carry trash with you while exploring Tokyo. Trash Treasure fixes that problem. It will show you the nearest trash bin and guides you to it. Now, throwing away trash is no longer a problem!
